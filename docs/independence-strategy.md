## 📊 Current Dependency Analysis

**Mem0 Usage Assessment:**
- **References Found**: 160 occurrences across codebase
- **Dependency**: `mem0ai>=0.1.114` in pyproject.toml
- **Current Cost**: Variable based on API usage
- **Risk**: External dependency for core functionality

**Independence Assets:**
- ✅ **Simple Memory Service**: Already built (`simple_memory_service.py`)
- ✅ **SQLite Backend**: Local, cost-free storage
- ✅ **Memory Bridge**: Abstraction layer ready for replacement
- ✅ **Autonomous Intelligence**: Core logic independent of Mem0
